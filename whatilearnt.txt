Hadoop :(A basic software for analysing big data and processing it )
so basically it is an open source source software based on java framework (for utilities)
It provides massive storage for any kind of data, enormous processing power and the ability to handle virtually limitless concurrent tasks or jobs.
It basically works on two concepts 
:
hdfs : contains the secondary node and data node 

Yarn(Yet Another Resource Negotiator) : it process the data and then its fxn reduce () helps in map reducing 
1. Capacity: Hadoop stores large volume
2. Speed: Hadoop stores and retrieves data fasters of data.
